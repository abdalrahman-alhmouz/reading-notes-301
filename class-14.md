# Database Normalization

* Database normalization is the process to organize database into tables and columns.

* Its used to organize tables into one purpose so we can reduce the number of duplicate data.

## Reasons for DB Normalization
* Reasons for database normalization:

1-Minimize duplicate data.

2-Mininmize data modification issues.

3-Simplify queries.

## Data Duplications
* Duplicate information gives us these problems:
1-Increases storage size and decreases performance.

2-Data becomes harder to maintain changes.

## Types of DB Normalizations
* There are 3 types of DB Normalization:

1-First Normal Form (1NF) No repeating groups of columns.

2-Second Normal Form (2NF): Its in first normal form and depends on tables primary key.

3-Third Normal Form (3NF): Its in second normal form and all columns are not dependent on primary key.
