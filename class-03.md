# Flexbox and Templating

## Templating with Mustache.js 

* Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.

* Mustache is logic less template syntax.

* logic less means there is no if statements,else or for loops, only tags.

* Mustache is not a templating engine,rather its a specification for templating language.

* It can be installed by npm using npm install mustache --save

## Flexbox

* First we need to make a container that all the other elements go in, and give it display:flex;

* you can change flex direction using flex-direction, either by rows or columns and reverse with each one.

* flex wrap so it goes to the next line and not try to all be put in one line

* justify content gives the spacing depending on whats needed, but some of its values are not supported by all browsers.

* use align-items to align vertically
