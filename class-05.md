# Heroku Deployment

## Before you can use heroku you need an account on it, so go create one!

## Also you need to install node.Js and npm and then install heroku on terminal

* Once you finish the installing and loging in

* You need an application that you want to deploy to herko already existing

* To deploy the app:
1- Create an app on heroku using **heroku create**, this will create a remote called heroku.

2- to deploy it, use **git push heroku master**

3- Ensure one instance of the app is running using **heroku ps:scale web=1**

4- Open the URL generated by its app name, you can use **heroku open**

* To view information about your running app, you can use **heroku logs --tail**
