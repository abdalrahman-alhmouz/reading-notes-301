# Update and delete: SENDING FORM DATA

## Form Data

* Form data has action and method attributes

* The action defines where the data will be sent, either a relative or an absolute URL

* The method attribute defines how the data is sent, it can be sent by GET method which will place the query at the top of the link as the body of the data will be empty

* POST method which will put the information inside the body of the HTTP request

* To view HTTP requests you need to use tools like chrome developer tools.

## Retrieving data on the server side

* There are many ways to retrieve data,which includes:
1-Raw PHP
2-Python
3-Express for NodeJS
4-Ruby on rails for Ruby

* We use express nodeJS 

## Summary

* Sending data is easy but securing an application can be tricky, also we must becareful about the security and not let the front end developer define the security model.
