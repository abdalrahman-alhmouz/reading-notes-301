# Read: 09 - Refactoring

## Functional programming

* Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

* Pure functions: they return the same result if given the same argument and it does not cause any observable side effects.

* Impure function is a function that uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter 

* Functions that read external files are not pure functions

* Random number generator functions are not pure functions.

* Higher order functions are functions that take multiple arguments or return a function as its result

## We can refactor JS functions by giving more details

* Like adding more comments

* Like giving spaces between every block of code to make it more tidy.

* Using understandable variable names.
