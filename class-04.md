# Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions

## Grid 

* grid is a great way for layout systems that is available in css

* first you must specify display grid

* you can add the number of rows and columns in grids using grid-template-columns and rows in a container div

* grid-column-cap and row gives some margin between different grid items

* justify-item justifies items that are inside the grid itself in their own boxes

* align items is similiar to justify item but on the vertical axis

* justify-content works the same as it did in grid, but compared to the parent of the grid container

* align-content same as above but for vertical alignment

## Regular expressions (regex) 

* Regex's are are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern like ASCII or Unicode.

* basic examples: ^ex matches any string that starts with ex

* example$ matches any string that ends with example 

* ^example$ matches a string that is exactly example

* there are more options like quanitifers [2], OR operators, character classes...
